## Security & User Information Notice

In this current state, the app is available to use as a **DEMO ONLY**, as security and testing still need to be run to make sure the application does not have any security issues.

All of the user data for this web app are stored in a MongoDB Database, and passwords are being safely encrypted using **bcrypt**.

Since this application is still being built, keep in mind **database will be wiped out periodically & without warning**, as this app is still in its testing stages. Make sure to backup any information you would like to keep.

Although I do not always create separate commits for each of them. I'm hoping to be more consistent with their usage as development progresses.
